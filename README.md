1         About   Community   Management   and   Organisations   
1.1         An   Introduction   to   this   SubjectThis   subject   focuses   on   community    management    in   Australia    and   the   social   and   economic   factors   that    influence   and   frame   community   management   practices.    At   the    macro    level,   it   examines   the   effects   of   neo-liberal   (economic   rationalist)   reforms   in   the   public   and   community   sectors;   and   the   rise   of   developments   such   as   managerialism   and   ’third way’ approaches, on community   management   practices.    The subject also explores developments   in   management   practices    in    response   to   social   developments   such    as    multiculturalism,    recognition    of   diversity,    equal   employment   opportunity and   recognition of contextual and   local   issues.    It further   looks at   community   management   work   practices,   including   volunteerism,   steering   committees,   management   committees,   and   collectives.
1.2         What   is   Expected   of   You
Study   Load
A   student   is   expected   to   study   an   hour   per   credit   point   a   week.    For   example   a   10   credit   point   subject   would   require
10   hours   of   study   per   week.   This   time   includes   the   time   spent   within   classes   during   lectures,   tutorials   or   practicals.Note   for Summer   Terms:    As   Summer subjects   deliver   the   same   content   and   classes   over   a   shorter period   of time,   the   subjects   are   run   in   a   more   intensive   mode.    Regardless   of the   delivery   mode,    the   study   hours   for   each   subject   in   Summer   will   be   around   30   hours.
Attendance
It   is   strongly   recommended   that   students   attend   all   scheduled   learning   activities   to   support   their   learning.
Approach   to   Learning
The   Subject   is   delivered   by:
(i)   8   x   2   hour   tutorials:   These   will   be   conducted   principally   as   face-to-face   delivery   mode,   with   a   limited   number   of   on-line   tutorial   groups;   and
(i) 3 x on-line   lectures with   assigned activities. These   will   be   conducted   every   third   week,   and   there   will   be   no   tutorials   in   that   week.
Instructions   for   accessing   the   on-line   tutorial   rooms   will   be   emailed   to   you   in   advance   of   the   tutorial.    Please   check   your   calendar   each   week   for   delivery   mode.Students   are   expected   to   engage   with   all   lectures   and   to   attend   all   tutorials   and   to   participate   actively   in   all   class   activities.    Failure   to   do   so   may   seriously   undermine   a   student’s   ability   to   complete   the   subject   satisfactorily.    Atten-   dance   records   may   be   consulted   in the   assessment of any   requests for   extensions   or   Special   Consideration.    You should   advise   the   Subject   Coordinator   or   your   tutor   if   you   are   unable   to   attend   a   tutorial   due   to   illness   or   misadventure.   This   subject    is   worth    10   credit    points,    indicating    that   success    in   the   subject    requires    at    least    10    hours   work    per   week.    Two    (2)   hours   will   be   lecture/tutorial   time   and   the   remaining   eight   (8)   hours   should   be   devoted   to   reading   and   study,   assessment   preparation,   and   revision.    In   this   subject   you   will   need   to   devote   much   of this   time   to   reading   the   textbook   and   reading   materials.
Online   Learning   RequirementsSubject   materials   will   be   made   available   on   the   subject’s   vUWS   (E-Learning)   site   (https://vuws.westernsydney.edu.   au/).   You   are expected to consult vUWS   at   least twice   a   week,   as   all   subject   announcements   will   be   made   via   vUWS.   Teaching   and   learning   materials   will   be   regularly   updated   and   posted   online   by   the   teaching   team.

Feedback   on   Assessment
Feedback   is   an   important   part   of the   learning   process   that   can   improve   your   progress   towards   achieving   the   learning   outcomes.      Feedback   is   any   written   or   spoken   response   made   in   relation   to   academic   work   such   as   an   assessment   task,   a   performance   or   product.    It   can    be   given   to   you   by   a   teacher,   an   external   assessor   or   student   peer,   and   may   be   given   individually   or   to   a   group   of   students.    As   a   Western   Sydney   University   student,   it   is   your   responsibility   to   seek   out   and   act   on   feedback   that   is   provided   to   you   as   a   resource   to   further   your   learning.Note:    Before   you   receive   your   results   for   each   piece   of   assessment   they   may   be   moderated.    Moderation   is   a    process   whereby   the   subject   coordinator   regulates   the   marking   of   individual   markers   to   achieve   consistency   in   the   application   of   subject   objectives,   performance   standards   and   marking   criteria.      Marks   for   an   individual   piece   of   assessment   will   not   be   changed   after   you   have   your   mark   or   grade.   You   should   note   that,   consistent   with   the   Criteria   and   Standards   Based Assessment   policy, the final   marks for the   cohort   may   be   also   adjusted   if   results   are   very   high   or   low   or   there   are   inconsistencies   between   groups.    General   submission    requirements   There   will   be   a   detailed   marking   criteria   provided   on   vUWS   for   all   assessments   prior   to   the   due   date/s.    Students   are   to   keep   a   copy   of   all   assignments   submitted   for   marking.
